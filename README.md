# Web-API-Quiz
- The JavaScript code provides a simple quiz application with multiple-choice questions and a time limit.
- Users interact with a start screen to begin the quiz and are presented with a timer that counts down from the total time allocated for all questions.
- A feedback mechanism informs users of the correctness of their answers, distinguishing between correct and incorrect responses.
- Upon completion of the quiz or when the timer expires, users are directed to an end screen where their final score is displayed.
- Users can save their high scores by entering their initials, with the scores stored locally for future reference.
- The code utilizes event listeners to manage user interactions, including starting the quiz, submitting answers, and entering initials for high score submission.
- Additional features such as quiz restart functionality and displaying high scores on a separate page could enhance the overall user experience.
